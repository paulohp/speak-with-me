It then emits an ```speechResult``` event with an ```Array()``` including of your ```recognizedWords```. You can then ```.indexOf()``` the array to trigger some awesome action to happen, like turning on your ```Philips Hue``` lights.\n\nIf you ever talked to your XBOX360 (kinect) you're already familiar on how a continuous speech recognition system works for you.\n\n## How\n\nIt's pure JavaScript magic... Ok, not yet! Currently node-speakable needs you to __put a binary of ```sox```__ into the modules (into lib) folder to do the recording. The actual voice recognition is then achieved trough a POST to the the Google Speech API.\n\n## Example usage (node example.js)\n\n```javascript\nvar Speakable = require('./');\n\nvar speakable = new Speakable();\n```\nBy default, the language is American English ( 'en-US' ), but you can specify another language in the options.\nExample usage:\n```javascript\nvar speakable = new Speakable({lang: 'it-IT'});\n```\n\n```javascript\nspeakable.on('speechStart', function() {\n  console.log('onSpeechStart');\n});\n\nspeakable.on('speechStop', function() {\n  console.log('onSpeechStop');\n});\n\nspeakable.on('speechReady', function() {\n  console.log('onSpeechReady');\n});\n\nspeakable.on('error', function(err) {\n  console.log('onError:');\n  console.log(err);\n  speakable.recordVoice();\n});\n\nspeakable.on('speechResult', function(recognizedWords) {\n  console.log('onSpeechResult:')\n  console.log(recognizedWords);\n  speakable.recordVoice();\n});\n\nspeakable.recordVoice();\n```\n\n## License\n\n**node-speakable** is licensed under the MIT license.\n\n## Todo / Ideas\n\n* Allow overwrite of speakableâ€™s defaults (sox path & parameters, etc.)\n* Limit maximum listening time\n",
